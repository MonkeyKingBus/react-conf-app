# React Conf 2017

The companion app for [React Conf 2017](http://conf.reactjs.org) in Santa Clara, California. Powered by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), and built in Sydney by [Thinkmill](https://www.thinkmill.com.au).

Get a live schedule, information about the talks and speakers, and easily tweet or share talks as they happen.

## About the App

We're open sourcing this early as a preview, it's been submitted to the app store and will hopefully be available in a couple of days. We'll add a link to the app here when that happens.

There will be design tweaks and updates as we lead up to the conference - we'll also be publishing the final Sketch files when they're ready.

PRs and feedback are welcome, let us know what you think!

And for those of you who will be attending, we hope you enjoy the app, and we'll see you there.

## Getting Started

To run the app, clone this repo then use `yarn` to install its dependencies.

Open the project in XCode and click "Play". You should be good to go!
